Blood and Sand
==============

- 1 part Whiskey
- 1 part Orange Juice
- 3/4 part Cherry Liquor (commonly Cherry Heering)
- 3/4 part Sweet Vermouth

Mix into a shaker with ice; shake, strain, serve.

Commonly found using equal parts, but I guess I prefer mine a little less sweet.

On Which Whiskey
----------------

Use whatever you like, some like it smokey, some like it smooth.
